# Diagnosify Healthcare Application

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the all-inclusive medical solution Diagnosify can identify seven distinct diseases, including COVID-19, brain tumors, breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, pneumonia, and heart disease. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed in the project to train and categorize patient picture data. The CNNs are able to detect the seven illnesses with an accuracy of over 90% after being trained on a dataset of more than 100,000 photos.

Our new tool called Diagnosify has the potential to completely change how illnesses are diagnosed. Although the initiative is still in its infancy, it has the potential to improve access to and cost-effectiveness of healthcare for individuals all around the world. 

Diagnosify is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the early detection of diseases. The project has the potential to save lives and improve the quality of life for millions of people. 

A thorough booking system and an intelligent AI chatbot have also been added. Users of the booking system may quickly set up appointments with medical specialists, expediting the procedure and cutting down on waiting periods. The AI chatbot responds to users' questions about illnesses, symptoms, and medical knowledge while offering them individualized advice.
